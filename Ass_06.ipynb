    "Any entity that has state and behavior is known as an object. For example, a chair, pen, table, keyboard, bike, etc. It can be physical or logical.\n",
    "An Object can be defined as an instance of a class. An object contains an address and takes up some space in memory. Objects can communicate without knowing the details of each other's data or code. The only necessary thing is the type of message accepted and the type of response returned by the objects.\n",

    "An attribute is defined as a quality or characteristic of a person, place, or thing. Real life individuals and fictional characters possess various attributes.\t\n",
    "Behaviour:\n",
    "The behavior of an object is defined by its methods, which are the functions and subroutines defined within the object class. ... Methods determine what type of functionality a class has, how it modifies its data, and its overall behavior.\n",
